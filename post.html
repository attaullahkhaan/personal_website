                <h1>What is Blockchain?</h2>
                    <p>Blockchain.com is a cryptocurrency financial services company. The company began as the first
                        Bitcoin blockchain explorer in 2011 and later created a cryptocurrency wallet that accounted for
                        28% of bitcoin transactions between 2012 and 2020.</p>
                    <p>A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer
                        network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format.
                        Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin,for
                        maintaining a
                        secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it
                        guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need
                        for a trusted third party. </p>

                    <p>One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A
                        blockchain collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of
                        information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to
                        the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. All new
                        information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that
                        will then also be added to the chain once filled.</p>

                    <p>A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, as its name implies,
                        structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure
                        inherently makes an irreversible timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized nature.
                        When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part of this timeline. Each block in
                        the chain is given an exact timestamp when it is added to the chain.</p>

                    <h1>Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Bitcoin has a short investing history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good
                        investment depends on your financial profile, investing portfolio, risk tolerance, and investing
                        goals. You should always consult a financial professional for advice before investing in
                        cryptocurrency to ensure it is right for your circumstances
